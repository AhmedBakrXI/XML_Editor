## Background

This project is a part of the Data Structures and Algorithms course at the ASU Faculty of engineering Computer department. The course covers the fundamental concepts and techniques of designing and implementing efficient and effective data structures and algorithms. The course also provides hands-on experience in applying these concepts and techniques to solve real-world problems.

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the understanding and application of the data structures and algorithms learned in the course.
